                My name is Patrick Jensen Martins, I'm 21 years old, I was born in Denmark and lived in Portugal since I was 4 years old until moving back to Denmark in 2018. I am currently in my 3rd Semester of my AP Degree in Multimedia Design and
                Communication, at KEA.

                No, I love memes! From all type of sources, being from Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or most recently, Tiktok. I enjoy playing videogames in my freetime, to have a chilling football encounter with friends and most of all, and
                whenever it is possible, spend time with my family and beloved ones.

                    With this education, I have acquired useful design and web-development skill sets that include proficiency in HTML, CSS and Javascript, working with GSAP, using tools like Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop and Premiere Pro for
                    digital content and using Wordpress as a CMS, focused on business.

                    While working as a vikar for JKS, at Bisca, in the packaging area, I learned that team work really makes the dream work and that really gets set to proof when a machine suddenly stops working and we have to work together to pack
                    the cakes that keep on coming from the line and adapt to a new role. I have tried different lines in the factory with different teams, and in all the times there is a defined structure on how to rotate position as time runs.

      <p>
        After having learned the amazing manipulation powers on SVGs using Adobe Illustrator, Javascript and GSAP, I helped my group on creating an interactive website about the impact of the light bulb in our society for our client, the Danish
        Museum of Science & Technology, we all designed SVGs for different elements of the room scene and the slides. I also worked on the functionality of the slides, changing the content inside them and going back and forward when a specific arrow
        is clicked as well as some animations using GSAP.

        For the second semester final project, we were responsible for creating a digital strategy for an artist, which involved client research, market research, the development of a website that included a SEO Strategy and a content strategy for
        social media. All the content on the about page, the contact page and the paintings as well as the gallery elements are all dynamic and can therefore be edited by the artist in Wordpress.

      <p>
        In my second semester I was introduced to Wordpress and how to use it as a CMS. I worked with a group where we used Wordpress as a database to store all the movies, their text content and add events with a custom post type using the Pods
        framework and add labels to each post of that type. Individually we designed our version of the website, based on the current one.

      <p>
        This was my first project with a group, during my study at KEA. We created an interactive website, intended for Cinemateket, with the basic knowledge about CSS positioning and animations that we had acquired. This interactive poster was to be
        used by a specific target group which we imagined and had to therefore be attractive and related to a movie selected by us, which was Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The website is only usable in desktop view.
